# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Generally togglz only supports the latest version.
If we need to fix a security issue, we will not backport it to older versions and as such strongly recommend to update togglz versions in use as soon as they get released.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you want to report a security issue, please contact [bennetelli](https://github.com/bennetelli) or [hennr](https://github.com/hennr/)
