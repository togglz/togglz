# Spring Boot Hello World Sample with Feature Enums

This web application sample uses basic Togglz auto configuration.
This example stores Feature Toggles in an Enum class instead of an application.yml file.
The admin console is explicitly configured as not secure for demo purpose.

Run `mvn clean spring-boot:run`

The sample project also contains `MockMvc` integration tests.
